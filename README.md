# Sudoku
This is a simple Sudoku game in Python. The game allows you to play Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. It also lets you solve different types of Sudoku puzzles.

Made entirely using Pygame. However, I used the dosuku API to get puzzles.

If you are on Mac, you can also run the main Unix executable to run the program.

# How to use
- Use arrows to navigate through empty squares
- Click on an empty square to select it
- Type a number to "pencil" it in
- Lock the number in by pressing Enter
